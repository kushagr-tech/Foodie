taste rated 40 ratedn  though very sadly the place looks in need of retouching but the food was great especially when it was super cold outside and we were super hungry the staff was nice we ordered the pink pasta and a pizza both of them were pretty good was really tempted to try their churros but we were stuffed worth a visit and try for sure rated 30 ratedn  churros the restaurants eponymous offering has to be tried theyre a mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce milkshakes are good too the interior walls have murals and writings all over havent tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good rated 30 ratedn  honestly have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains  never tried desserts so this review is based on starters and mains only the quality wasnt all that great was pretty average rated 40 ratedn  visited this place for the first time recently the ambience was pretty good we ordered two churros for two having churros for the first time ever i was way too excited and judgmental but swear to lord the churros were heavenly the chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xd we had taken the cross country ranch pizza it was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggiesnthe place is famous for churros the name suggests so i would love to visit again to try all the other items out  rated 40 ratedn  i love the desserts more than anything here good place and well served nwe dint like the nachos here  it was not that good as we expected nexcept nachos almost all dish were quite good rated 20 ratedn  2nd time i have visited this place and i am surprised to see how it has declined churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala garlic bread were topped with cheese with mayo yes mayonnese soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only savior was pasta and caramel pudding this place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 we still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower i did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other thatll be my last visit san churros",

 small cosy covered rooftop place provides just the right menu for quick bites as well as main coursennthe view is pretty in the evenings due to glass walls the ambience is good for a small gathering and hang out not exactly the kind of place for fine diningnnit doesnt seem to be like a popular hang out it is hard to even know if a cafe is existing therennhaving zomato gold membership works out well it was due to that we identified the place and went till there to utilise the benefit thank you zomato for the gold  nnwe tried veg steak pasta pizza and sizzlernthey provide thin crust pizza all the dishes were good and we enjoyed the foodnngiving 4 because the service was slower than expected it could improvennall in all its a quiet place and food price is slightly on the higher side considering the ambience and quantity but its worth it since it tastes good one could give it a try rated 40 ratedn  small cozy rooftop cafe with a wide spread menu not the place for a huge gang service is as expected dishes to try are the range of pizzas go to items like burgers and mocktails are also well prepared for a small place it has more than the required items on the menu so overall a pleasant experience rated 40 ratedn  went out to try their burgers and they were pretty good the ambience was that of a rustic pub and the people are nice the service is pretty slownfood  355nambience  45nservice  355 rated 30 ratedn  a small roof top cafe on the main roadnwent around 1pm and we were the only people but later came some 7 to 8 people in another 30 minutesnordered 2 chicken burgerswhich was really goodnservice is greatnambience is cool and fruit beer is alos available here rated 20 ratedn  penthouse cafe is located in banashankari its on the 4th floor and is right opposite to cafe coffee day on the main road first the place seems really shady the entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floornthe place is really tiny and seems good only thing that seemed nice about the place we had the nachos cheese and salsa the mayo along with this was so runny and milky the cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didnt have any next up my friend and i tried the pink sauce pasta the pasta was overcooked the sauce wasnt creamy at all it lacked in taste it had garlic bread along with it and it tasted decently but highly disappointed with this place i took my friend to this place with a lot of expectations and we were disappointed rated 40 ratedn  situated in upper floor this cafe wasnt much known to me if i wouldnt find it in zomato it was bit early when we entered hence there were hardly 24 ppl in the cafe a small call place it was with light music we had ordered veg pasta bbq chicken wings peri peri pizza all tasted good pasta could be better service was good rated 50 ratedn  best place to have food and a very friendly staffed cafe price is very reasonable and the drinks are really really amazing  no comments of this cafe as everything was very goodthey also have a smoking zone rated 10 ratedn  disappointing a friend of mine had told me its a below average cafe but i did not believe it looking at the ratings visited myself today and he was right masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 rs left it after two sipsnnpesto garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 rs virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of limennoverall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food not sure about their other food items as i did not even wanted to venture further when the tea arrived rated 40 ratedn  35 would be the actual rating but would not like to discourage hence 4 there are much better options available surrounded

suggests so i would love to visit again to try all the other items out  rated 40 ratedn  i love the desserts more than anything here good place and well served nwe dint like the nachos here  it was not that good as we expected nexcept nachos almost all dish were quite good rated 20 ratedn  2nd time i have visited this place and i am surprised to see how it has declined churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala garlic bread were topped with cheese with mayo yes mayonnese soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only savior was pasta and caramel pudding this place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 we still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower i did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other thatll be my last visit san churros",

i have visited this place and i am surprised to see how it has declined churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala garlic bread were topped with cheese with mayo yes mayonnese soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only savior was pasta and caramel pudding this place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 we still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower i did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other thatll be my last visit san churros",

 small cosy covered rooftop place provides just the right menu for quick bites as well as main coursennthe view is pretty in the evenings due to glass walls the ambience is good for a small gathering and hang out not exactly the kind of place for fine diningnnit doesnt seem to be like a popular hang out it is hard to even know if a cafe is existing therennhaving zomato gold membership works out well it was due to that we identified the place and went till there to utilise the benefit thank you zomato for the gold  nnwe tried veg steak pasta pizza and sizzlernthey provide thin crust pizza all the dishes were good and we enjoyed the foodnngiving 4 because the service was slower than expected it could improvennall in all its a quiet place and food price is slightly on the higher side considering the ambience and quantity but its worth it since it tastes good one could give it a try rated 40 ratedn  small cozy rooftop cafe with a wide spread menu not the place for a huge gang service is as expected dishes to try are the range of pizzas go to items like burgers and mocktails are also well prepared for a small place it has more than the required items on the menu so overall a pleasant experience rated 40 ratedn  went out to try their burgers and they were pretty good the ambience was that of a rustic pub and the people are nice the service is pretty slownfood  355nambience  45nservice  355 rated 30 ratedn  a small roof top cafe on the main roadnwent around 1pm and we were the only people but later came some 7 to 8 people in another 30 minutesnordered 2 chicken burgerswhich was really goodnservice is greatnambience is cool and fruit beer is alos available here rated 20 ratedn  penthouse cafe is located in banashankari its on the 4th floor and is right opposite to cafe coffee day on the main road first the place seems really shady the entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floornthe place is really tiny and seems good only thing that seemed nice about the place we had the nachos cheese and salsa the mayo along with this was so runny and milky the cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didnt have any next up my friend and i tried the pink sauce pasta the pasta was overcooked the sauce wasnt creamy at all it lacked in taste it had garlic bread along with it and it tasted decently but highly disappointed with this place i took my friend to this place with a lot of expectations and we were disappointed rated 40 ratedn  situated in upper floor this cafe wasnt much known to me if i wouldnt find it in zomato it was bit early when we entered hence there were hardly 24 ppl in the cafe a small call place it was with light music we had ordered veg pasta bbq chicken wings peri peri pizza all tasted good pasta could be better service was good rated 50 ratedn  best place to have food and a very friendly staffed cafe price is very reasonable and the drinks are really really amazing  no comments of this cafe as everything was very goodthey also have a smoking zone rated 10 ratedn  disappointing a friend of mine had told me its a below average cafe but i did not believe it looking at the ratings visited myself today and he was right masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 rs left it after two sipsnnpesto garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 rs virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of limennoverall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food not sure about their other food items as i did not even wanted to venture further when the tea arrived rated 40 ratedn  35 would be the actual rating but would not like to discourage hence 4 there are much better options available surrounded the place again a rooftop convert to a restaurant small well done interiors for its type and nice lighting and good view from top during evening tried sizzler and rice both were average nothing much

pathetic loaded nachos and masala garlic bread were topped with cheese with mayo yes mayonnese soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only savior was pasta and caramel pudding this place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 we still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower i did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about

declined churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala garlic bread were topped with cheese with mayo yes mayonnese soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only savior was pasta and caramel pudding this place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 we still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower i did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other thatll be my last visit san churros",

like the ambience and the fact that it is a rooftop makes it a cool place to hangout although i keep ordering almost the same thing every time it has always turned out to be a nice experience this

visited in the last couple of years onesta has made a name for itself we did not have pizza places that have a buffet optionnnlike any other onesta the taste is right up there and the quick service i

        "rated 30 ratedn  i had been to this place with one of my friends its a very small place but decent and nice place to hangoutnfood355nambience45nvalue for money 355 rated 40 ratedn  small cosy covered rooftop place provides just the right menu for quick bites as well as main coursennthe view is pretty in the evenings due to glass walls the ambience is good for a small gathering and hang out not exactly the kind of place for fine diningnnit doesnt seem to be like a popular hang out it is hard to even know if a cafe is existing therennhaving zomato gold membership works out well it was due to that we identified the place and went till there to utilise the benefit thank you zomato for the gold  nnwe tried veg steak pasta pizza and sizzlernthey provide thin crust pizza all the dishes were good and we enjoyed the foodnngiving 4 because the service was slower than expected it could improvennall in all its a quiet place and food price is slightly on the higher side considering the ambience and quantity but its worth it since it tastes good one could give it a try rated 40 ratedn  small cozy rooftop cafe with a wide spread menu not the place for a huge gang service is as expected dishes to try are the range of pizzas go to items like burgers and mocktails are also well prepared for a small place it has more than the required items on the menu so overall a pleasant experience rated 40 ratedn  went out to try their burgers and they were pretty good the ambience was that of a rustic pub and the people are nice the service is pretty slownfood  355nambience  45nservice  355 rated 30 ratedn  a small roof top cafe on the main roadnwent around 1pm and we were the only people but later came some 7 to 8 people in another 30 minutesnordered 2 chicken burgerswhich was really goodnservice is greatnambience is cool and fruit beer is alos available here rated 20 ratedn  penthouse cafe is located in banashankari its on the 4th floor and is right opposite to cafe coffee day on the main road first the place seems really shady the entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floornthe place is really tiny and seems good only thing that seemed nice about the place we had the nachos cheese and salsa the mayo along with this was so runny and milky the cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didnt have any next up my friend and i tried the pink sauce pasta the pasta was overcooked the sauce wasnt creamy at all it lacked in taste it had garlic bread along with it and it tasted decently but highly disappointed with this place i took my friend to this place with a lot of expectations and we were disappointed rated 40 ratedn  situated in upper floor this cafe wasnt much known to me if i wouldnt find it in zomato it was bit early when we entered hence there were hardly 24 ppl in the cafe a small call place it was with light music we had ordered veg pasta bbq chicken wings peri peri pizza all tasted good pasta could be better service was good rated 50 ratedn  best place to have food and a very friendly staffed cafe price is very reasonable and the drinks are really really amazing  no comments of this cafe as everything was very goodthey also have a smoking zone rated 10 ratedn  disappointing a friend of mine had told me its a below average cafe but i did not believe it looking at the ratings visited myself today and he was right masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 rs left it after two sipsnnpesto garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 rs virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of limennoverall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food not sure about their other food items as i did not even wanted to venture further when the tea arrived rated 40 ratedn  35 would be the actual rating but would not like to discourage hence 4 there are much better options available surrounded

try for sure rated 30 ratedn  churros the restaurants eponymous offering has to be tried theyre a mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce milkshakes are good too the interior walls have murals and writings all over havent tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good rated 30 ratedn  honestly have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains  never tried desserts so this review is based on starters and mains only the quality wasnt all that great was pretty average rated 40 ratedn  visited this place for the first time recently the ambience was pretty good we ordered two churros for two having churros for the first time ever i was way too excited and judgmental but swear to lord the churros were heavenly the chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xd we had taken the cross country ranch pizza it was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggiesnthe place is famous for churros the name suggests so i would love to visit again to try all the other items out  rated 40 ratedn  i love the desserts more than anything here good place and well served nwe dint like the nachos here  it was not that good as we expected nexcept nachos almost all dish were quite good rated 20 ratedn  2nd time i have visited this place and i am surprised to see how it has declined churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala garlic bread were topped with cheese with mayo yes mayonnese soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only savior was pasta and caramel pudding this place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 we still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower i did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other thatll be my last visit san churros",

melt chicken wrap this is a new wrap in their menu for all the cheese lovers out their but according to me the amount of cheese that they put in should be made less because more of cheese makes the
